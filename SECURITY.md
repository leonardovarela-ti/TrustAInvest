# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TrustAInvest platform to protect user data and ensure secure operations.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT-based Authentication
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication
- Tokens contain user information (ID, username, email, role)
- Token expiration: 24 hours
- Secure token storage using FlutterSecureStorage
- Token validation on every protected request

### Multi-factor Authentication States
1. **Account States**
   - Unauthenticated: No valid JWT token
   - Authenticated: Valid JWT token present
   - Pending KYC: Registered but awaiting verification
   - Inactive: Account not active
   - Email Unverified: Email verification pending

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - API Gateway integration with AWS Cognito
   - Protected routes requiring valid authentication
   - CORS protection for API endpoints

## Data Protection

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing for password storage
- Minimum password length: 8 characters
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Secure password reset flow

### Sensitive Data Encryption
- SSN encryption using industry-standard algorithms
- Encrypted data storage in database
- Secure key management
- Data encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)

### API Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- API Gateway authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Input sanitization

## Infrastructure Security
