# AWS Infrastructure Cost Estimate

This document provides an estimated monthly cost breakdown for the TrustAInvest infrastructure in the dev environment. The estimate assumes minimal usage (infrastructure running without significant traffic or data processing).

## Cost Breakdown

| Service | Configuration | Estimated Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **RDS PostgreSQL** | db.t3.small, 20GB storage, single AZ | $30.00 | Basic tier for development |
| **ElastiCache Redis** | cache.t3.small, single node | $25.00 | In-memory caching |
| **ECS Fargate** | 12 services, minimal usage | $75.00 | Assuming 0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB RAM per service |
| **Application Load Balancer** | 1 ALB | $20.00 | Load balancing for services |
| **CloudFront** | Minimal data transfer | $10.00 | Content delivery network |
| **S3 Storage** | Multiple buckets, minimal storage | $5.00 | Document storage, logs, frontend assets |
| **Route 53** | Hosted zone, DNS queries | $1.00 | DNS management |
| **CloudWatch** | Logs, metrics, alarms | $15.00 | Monitoring and alerting |
| **Cognito** | User pool, minimal users | $0.00 | Free tier covers basic usage |
| **KMS** | Multiple keys | $3.00 | $1 per key per month |
| **SNS & SQS** | Topics and queues | $1.00 | Messaging services |
| **ECR** | Container repositories | $1.00 | Storage for Docker images |
| **VPC & Networking** | NAT Gateway, data transfer | $35.00 | NAT Gateway hourly charge is significant |
| **IAM & Service Discovery** | IAM roles, service discovery | $0.00 | No charge for these services |
| **WAF** | Web Application Firewall | $10.00 | Basic protection |
| **Data Transfer** | Minimal inter-service communication | $5.00 | Data transfer between services |
| **Total** | | **$236.00** | Approximate monthly cost |

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Development Environment Scheduling**
   - Consider scheduling the development environment to run only during business hours
   - Potential savings: 60-70% on compute resources (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache)

2. **Right-sizing Resources**
   - Review and adjust instance sizes based on actual usage patterns
   - Consider using RDS t3.micro instead of t3.small for development
   - Potential savings: 20-30% on compute resources

3. **NAT Gateway Alternatives**
   - Use NAT Instances instead of NAT Gateways for development
   - Potential savings: $30-35 per month

4. **Reserved Instances**
   - For production environments, consider purchasing Reserved Instances for RDS and ElastiCache
   - Potential savings: 30-60% on those services

5. **S3 Lifecycle Policies**
   - Implement lifecycle policies to transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage tiers
   - Potential savings: Varies based on data volume

6. **CloudWatch Logs Retention**
   - Reduce log retention periods for development environments
   - Potential savings: 5-10% on CloudWatch costs

## Development vs. Production Cost Comparison

For a production environment with high availability and increased capacity, you can expect:

- **Development Environment**: ~$236/month (as estimated above)
- **Production Environment**: ~$800-1,200/month (3-5x higher due to multi-AZ, larger instances, and higher traffic)

## Notes and Assumptions

1. This estimate is based on AWS pricing as of April 2025 for the us-east-1 region
2. Actual costs may vary based on:
   - Actual usage patterns
   - Data transfer volumes
   - Storage growth
   - AWS price changes
3. The estimate does not include:
   - AWS Support plans
   - Reserved Instance purchases
   - Savings from AWS Enterprise Discount Program
4. For the most accurate estimate, consider using the AWS Pricing Calculator with your specific configuration details

## Monitoring and Controlling Costs

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**
   - Enable and use AWS Cost Explorer to track actual spending
   - Set up cost anomaly detection

2. **AWS Budgets**
   - Create budgets with alerts to notify when spending exceeds thresholds

3. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Implement comprehensive resource tagging to track costs by application, environment, and team

4. **Regular Reviews**
   - Conduct monthly cost reviews to identify optimization opportunities
   - Look for unused or underutilized resources
